This game was first written in 2014 by me. Who tought commenting would be necessary.

## How to get startted

Basicly, you just need to clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/shaiws/Checkers.git
```
and then run the Main.java file.

You will be promoted what kind of game would you like, local game, means two players on the same PC, or Online game, which is two players from two different computers.

In case you chose the online option, you first need to run 
```bash
 python3 server.py
```
This will setup a websocket server on the localhost.

## TODO
- [ ] Lots of bug fixes.
- [ ] Some edge cases in the game logic.
- [ ] Could be more.
